This is a baseline build prior to removal of some unnecessary code that never will be executed

2016-07-02_p1
Removed all rungs that have a "NeverHappen" in it.

2016-08-23
Update after yesterdays run where a buggfix bCORR001MK was inserted into "KAPSYLERING" to avoid fast turn of capping head on first occation (i.e. after fresh start of machine or after an interruption where you need to press START_AUTO again).
Code passages can be removed in RUNG 003 (KAP_STEG_1 -> KAP_STEG_2) as the CAP_IS_PREPARED (True/False) isn't needed anymore.

2016-09-13-P1
Zipped the project and uploaded to FTP server, no additional changes compared to the 2016-08-23 upload.
Reason for new upload is that Carlberg has done some rebuilding of machine and need to code updates. 

2016-09-13-P2
Carlberg: write down what changes you have done.
zip project but don't rename it.
Upload to folder
-Disk sequence: Added "packningsdisk" row 009 and below.
-HMI added packningsdisk start, stopp, time
-Styrning row 003, 004: Added TRACK_TILT_HOME
-HMI_MAN Capping cyl UP/DOWN HMI added buttons
-Styrning row 018 -021, Cap motor fwd/bwd
-Syrning row 007, noll added for OCM_1 not used
-Styrning row 024, change to KAP_STEG_5, IC_1 added
-Kapsylering row 007 Timer WAIT_FOR_CAP controlled from HMI for new cap feed and trim.

*Writing comments in "STYRNINGAR" to make it easier to find passages in the code

2016-10-16_P1_working
Efter ett fel så fick jag återställa till 09-13-P2

2016-10-16_P2_fast_down
Nu går fyllarrören ner snabbt efter inmatningen

2016-10-16_P3_CAPPING_POS
Lagt in capping pos som signal då denna saknades i maskinen. Svårt att förstå vilken terminal som Carlberg menade
Trial and Error.

2016-10-16_P4_Replaced_KAP_STEG_2_TIME_WITH_CAPPING_POS
In KAPSYLERING RUNG 003 CAPPING_POS as contact has replaced all timers

2016-10-16_P5_Event_based_short_timer_bottle_infeed
RUNG 009 i INMATNING.
Har ersatt en timer med eventbaserat (AND) + kort timer (Gör reuse på INM_STEG_4_TIMER)


2016-10-16_P6_time_for_capmotor_direction
Replaced set values for how long to turn capping motor in either direction to variables instead
tCAPForwardTime
tCAPBackwardTime

2016-10-23_P1_improvement listings
Updating code with improvements that can be done or should be checked.
Search for TODO
UTMATNING RUNG 002 - check TODO comment and also clean up other comments to make it consistant
UTMATNING RUNG 003 - Check TODO - timer necessity
FIXED****FYLLING RUNG 003 - Check TODO - remove signals check why we need the timer. This will have an e2e time impact
FIXED**** MAIN RUNG 012, 013, 014, 015, 016, 017, 018, 019, 020, 021, 022, 023 - Old unused, remove

2016-10-26_P1_cleanup_in_MAIN
I have removed passages in code that is not used anymore. This will make the code more readable.
There are however loads of unused variables that should be removed to get fewer warinings

2016-10-26_P2_Changes_in_fylling
Removed "IF_2" and "IF_2 inverse" after "SUMMA_LARM inverse" as it didn't fill any function for the machine

2016-10-26_P3_Changes_in_fylling
Removed Timer and "FYLL_STEG_2_TIME" that it was waiting for
Removed "FYLL_STEG_4" signal from RUNG004 (CONTACT) and also removed "FYLL_STEG_4" (COIL)
Removed an unused timer "STEG_5_TON" and its "FYLL_STEG_5_TIME" value

2016-10-26_P4_Changes_in_utmatning_and_larm
Removed comment "Added bWeHaveCounterPressure december 2" as it was not valid
Removed "FYLL_STEG_4" after "SUMMA_LARM" as "FYLL_STEG_4" is not used anymore
Removed "FYLL_STEG_3" after "SUMMA_LARM" as "FYLL_STEG_3" Should not use it here anyway.
In "LARM_HANTERING" a sysconf_parameter is added "bAlarmUseFillLevelAlarm" default set to FALSE. This disables the Fill level not reached alarm
IN UTMATNING RUNG 003 the timer STEG2_TON don't have any vital function, it is set to 20 ms so neglectable. I opted to keep it in code as it does not have e2e timing impact
STYRNINGAR RUNG 008 removed "INM_STEG_3" in series with "NOLL" the sequence was in paralell with the rest of the steps in beginning of rung
STYRNINGAR RUNG 007 converted the "NOLL" to a sysconf_parameter bCFGUseInfeedMotor

2016-12-20_Pre
Just a backup before any changes are done during bottling of Trossöl

2017-02-01_PostBottling
I have added a stage called 86 where the "No Foam limit" is reached it will open the regulator and also the Drain.

2017-07-04_BeforeCodeChanges_bottling
Doing a baseline upload without any changes as I want to adjust the timing of CO2 "venting" so it starts after passing bottle opening.
